# Niklas Burggraff .dotfiles

Repository containing my configuration .dotfiles.

## Setup

The install script is from [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/tree/328bcb32590e5057b09bd27a40bc2fb21385fbf3) which is a tool to set everything up.

```bash
cd
./install
```

## Configuration

The `install.conf.yaml` file contains the configuration.
It mainly creates symlinks for all the folders to make sure the configuration files are in the correct location.
